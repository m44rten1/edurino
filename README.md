# DIY Edurino Figures & Storage

This repository provides resources for recreating Edurino learning figures and storage solutions. Edurino is an educational toy system that uses conductive figures for interactive learning. Each figure is uniquely identified by three conductive pins positioned at specific distances from each other.

## Repository Contents

- **STL Files**: 3D printable models for:
  - Learning figures compatible with the Edurino system
  - Storage box to organize and protect your figures
- **Measurements**: Detailed pin spacing measurements for each figure
- **Stickers**: Printable figure designs to identify each disk

## 3D Printing

### Figures
The `STL/Figures` directory contains 3D models for each learning figure. These are designed as flat disks with three holes positioned at specific distances from each other, matching the original Edurino figures' pin placements. Instead of using conductive pins, these DIY versions work by guiding your fingers to the correct positions - you place your fingers in the holes to interact with the Edurino app, effectively using your fingers as the conductive pins. Each disk includes a flat surface on top where you can apply the corresponding character sticker for easy identification.

### Storage Box
The `STL/Box` directory contains models for a custom storage solution, designed to safely store and organize your Edurino figures.

### Stickers
Each figure comes with a matching sticker design that can be printed and applied to the top of the figure disk. This makes it easy to identify which disk belongs to which character. Print these on sticker paper for best results.

## Pin Measurements

All measurements are in millimeters (mm) and taken from the bottom view, following a clockwise pattern as shown:

```
A--------1------B
  .             |
    .           |
      .         |
        3       2
          .     |
            .   |
              . |
                B

1: Distance between pins A-B
2: Distance between pins B-C
3: Distance between pins C-A
```
