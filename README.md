# DIY Edurino Figure Measurements Guide

This guide provides measurements for recreating Edurino learning figures. Edurino is an educational toy system that uses conductive figures for interactive learning. Each figure is uniquely identified by three conductive pins positioned at specific distances from each other.

## Measurement Method

All measurements are in millimeters (mm) and taken from the bottom view, following a clockwise pattern as shown:

```
A--------1------B
  .             |
    .           |
      .         |
        3       2
          .     |
            .   |
              . |
                B

1: Distance between pins A-B
2: Distance between pins B-C
3: Distance between pins C-A
```
